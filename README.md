## Project overview

* Welcome to Celebration Brewing

* As a business owner, I want users to understand my location, beer offerings, company history and contact methods. 

* It is desired my beer offerings stay up-to-date based on inventory on untappd.com/celebrationbrewing. 

* It is desired users can submit their email address for newsletter distribution.

* It is desired a user can leave feedback & choose to be contacted via email. As an admin, I want to be able to login and view all feedback.
